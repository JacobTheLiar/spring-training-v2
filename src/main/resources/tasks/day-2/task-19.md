# Custom methods

We want to build a catalog view of all registered investors. Our users want
to be able to search investors in the catalog. Let's implement this requirement.

Your task is to allow searching investors by following criteria:

1. with given name exactly
2. with name containing a given string
3. by exact name length
4. by name length between x and y
5. only VIPs
6. only non-VIPs
7. by score equal to x
8. by score equal or greater than x
9. with ref link coming from a given partner
