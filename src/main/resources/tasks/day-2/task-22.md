# Schedulers

We want to send newsletters.

Your task is to create a newsletter service, that will send
messages for borrowers and investors. These newsletters should
be different for borrowers and investors. Newsletter should be sent once a
week by default, but the schedule should be configurable. You don't need to
send real email. A stubbed/mocked mailing service will suffice for the
needs of this task.
