# Pagination

Our catalog of registered investors is growing big. We can't any longer
simply load all investors and return them via the REST API.

Your task is to introduce pagination, so clients can request pages if
investors (e.g. page number 2 with 100 investors) instead
of all results. You don't need to do this for all methods. Just
create/select some.
